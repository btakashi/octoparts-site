## Moving pieces

Octoparts is composed of the following components:

- Web app built on the [Playframework](https://www.playframework.com/)
  - Wraps calls to registered endpoints in [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) [commands](http://netflix.github.io/Hystrix/javadoc/index.html?com/netflix/hystrix/HystrixCommand.html) to guarantee resilience and responsiveness
  - Caches endpoint configuration metadata and endpoint results to either EhCached or Memcached
- [Hystrix dashboard](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/tree/master/hystrix-dashboard) for Hystrix stream visualisation, deployed in Tomcat
  - If multiple Octoparts nodes are used, [Turbine](https://github.com/Netflix/Turbine/wiki/Getting-Started) is required for aggregating the Hystrix streams into a single stream to be consumed by the dashboard
- [Kibana](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/) for visualising log entry data
  - Log data from each Octoparts node is collected and aggregated via [fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org/) and stored in [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)
- [Alert Mailer](../alert-mails.html) that queries the aforementioned ElasticSearch datastore to monitor errors rates and, if errors surpass configured thresholds, sends alert emails
